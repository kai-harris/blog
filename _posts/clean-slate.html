<div>What have you built from a clean slate?</div><p /><div>Most of us have the luxury of sliding into the worn, comfortable pattern of "this is how it's done." &nbsp;And though it may be easy to fantasize about how *you* would do things differently when living, working, using, or otherwise tolerating what others have built, starting from scratch is hard. &nbsp;Most of us only do it when required.</div><p /><div>Try it. &nbsp;Experiment. &nbsp;Fail. &nbsp;Learn. &nbsp;Do Again.</div><p /><div>Waiting on the other side is understanding, growth, satisfaction, and perspective. &nbsp;Is now the time?</div>
