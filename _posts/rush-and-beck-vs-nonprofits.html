<div><a href="http://techcafeteria.com/blog/2010/08/20/why-does-the-right-attack-nonprofits/trackback/">Peter Campbell nicely summarizes nonprofit responses</a>&nbsp;to the current attacks on nonprofits employees as "lazy idiots" and "rapists" of the economy by Rush Limbaugh, including Robert Egger's great video response.</div>

<div>Quoted from Peter's excellent post:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>It&rsquo;s completely unintuitive and bizarre that nonprofits&mdash;poorly resourced organizations that struggle to do the work that our government does less and less of&mdash;are lambasted and threatened by the people that rally loudest for eliminating government programs. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re the ones who are getting important work done with funding that is volunteered, not assessed. &nbsp;Most nonprofits have no leftist or rightwing agenda&mdash;they have clearly stated missions that they&rsquo;re trying to serve (as Egger&rsquo;s video makes clear). &nbsp;Maybe Beck and Limbaugh should be a bit more appreciative of the fact that we enable mouths to be fed, museums and parks to stay open, and air to continue to be breathable in a country where the government can get fewer and fewer social services funded.</div>

<div>Some statistics:</div>
<div>
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li>Nonprofits reported over $1.4 trillion in total revenue and nearly $1.3 trillion in expenses in 2007. &nbsp;They also reported nearly $2.6 trillion in total assets. (<a href="http://nccs.urban.org/statistics/quickfacts.cfm">source</a>)</li>
<li>Nonprofits account for over 8% of all wages and salaries paid in the US in 2006. (<a href="http://nccs.urban.org/statistics/quickfacts.cfm">source</a>)</li>
<li>Nonprofits are not just touchy-feely social service organizations - Churches, Synagogues, and Mosques; the Boy and Girl Scouts, universities; hospitals; museums; bowling leagues; Parent Teacher Associations; &nbsp;and Veterans' organizations are all examples of nonprofits</li>
</ul>
