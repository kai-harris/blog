<div>Do you put in as much effort when nobody is looking as when&nbsp;a coach / boss / colleague / spouse isn't looking over your shoulder?</div>
<p />
<div>Seth Godin nails it in his post&nbsp;<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/05/self-directed-effort.html">Self Directed Effort is the Best Kind</a>. &nbsp;There is an entire industry setup to tell you that you can't put in the required effort without external forces. &nbsp;Do you really need rewards or punishment or cajoling to put forth your best effort?</div>
<p />
<div>Changing behavior to direct your own level of effort can be done is a series of small decisions that turn into a lifestyle and a mentality. &nbsp;Don't hit snooze, do an extra 5-10 minutes of focused work between breaks, run one last wind sprint when it seems you can't do another. &nbsp;Lose the one thing that most distracts you during the day.</div>
<p />
<div>Matter over Mind - small changes to your behavior will ultimately also change your mindset and it becomes part of you.</div>
