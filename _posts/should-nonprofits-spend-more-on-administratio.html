<div>Yes.</div>
<p />
<div>There, I said it. &nbsp;The administrative-cost ratio so prevalent as a measure of organizational efficiency and fiduciary responsibility can make nonprofits less effective. &nbsp;Every donor wants to see their donation spent on the mission of the organization and not on the costs associated with running the organization - would you rather your donation was spent digging a well in Africa or on donor/constituent management software? &nbsp;If the mission of an organization is building wells then it needs resources for not only the actual well-digging, but also for organizational development to make it the best, most effective well-digging organization possible. &nbsp;The emphasis by grantors, donors, and rating agencies on keeping administration costs as low as possible skews how money is spent within an organization and can make them less effective as a result.</div>
<p />
<div>You can help. &nbsp;If you're a donor, make your donations <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/64911/nonprofit_organizations_restricted.html">unrestricted</a>. &nbsp;If you work at a nonprofit, engage your donors and grantors with how you could build a better organization with more administrative investment - they might listen. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/27/business/27charity.html?_r=1">Charity Navigator is</a>.</div>

<div>Here are some excellent areas to increase Administrative spending:</div>
<div>
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li><strong>Professional Development for/of Leadership</strong>: Effective organizations require good leadership but nonprofits are penalized with higher administration costs when they invest in their leaders. &nbsp;This is also one of the underlying reasons I believe nonprofits tend to not be very good at succession planning; the resources aren't available or valued enough to groom new leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: It's easier, faster, and cheaper to build a house with power tools than by hand. &nbsp;New tools, better processes, a good work environment, etc. help organizations accomplish their missions better.</li>
<li><strong>Experimentation:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Efficiency (and associated low administrative cost) comes from iterative refinement of a process. &nbsp;Experimentation is not, by definition, efficient but it could find new ways of tackling a nonprofit's mission and perhaps change the world.</li>
</ul>
