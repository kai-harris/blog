<p>For Christmas, I made a donation in my dad's name to the&nbsp;<a href="http://sonomalandtrust.org/">Sonoma Land Trust</a>&nbsp;- to whom I had never donated. &nbsp;The next day, I was greeted with a wonderful thank you email that included a nice personal note about my dad and about me from Reta, the Donor Relations Director.</p>
<div>It turns out that Reta recently had lunch with my dad and she heard (and remembered!) who I was. &nbsp;But what if that lunch had taken place 7 months ago instead of 2 weeks? &nbsp;Would she still have been able to add that personal note to my thank you email? &nbsp;Well, Reta may have a good enough memory to pull that off, but for the rest of us:&nbsp;CRM&nbsp;to the rescue.
<p />
<div>In the nonprofit world,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM</a>&nbsp;stands for Constituent Relationship Management. &nbsp;It gives you a central place to track and organize relationships and constituent activities that are important to your organization. &nbsp;In this instance, the key points from that lunch conversation with my dad (including my name and some details about me) would be entered into his constituent record and then, when I donated, a simple search of the database for my name would bring up those notes and my thank you email gets a personal touch.</div>
<p />
</div>
<div>When was the last time you got a personal thank you note? &nbsp;I responded to the note and ended up having a great conversation with Reta. &nbsp;And now I am far more engaged and likely to donate again or make a phone call or send a letter on Sonoma Land Trust's behalf - all because I got a personal note from a gift donation.</div>
