<p><em>Administrative cost redux</em></p>

<p>Last month I blogged about <a href="http://blog.kaiharris.com/should-nonprofits-spend-more-on-administratio">why nonprofits should spend more on Administration</a> and why Administrative cost ratios are a bad measure of nonprofit performance.  Today, Charity Navigator posted a <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1193">Where We are Headed</a> page that outlines their new rating system.  The new rating system adds two new metrics to the original financial health metric (where admin cost ratio played prominently): (1) accountability &amp; transparency; and (2) results.</p>

<p>The results based measure will eventually be the heaviest weighted portion of their overall rating.  Outcomes based measurement has its own set of problems and can be difficult to measure but at least it attempts to measure and analyze how effective the organization is at doing its mission.  I applaud Charity Navigator for taking on this challenge and look forward to seeing how they will solve the major challenge of results-oriented rating systems: creating metrics that are general enough to be compared across different kinds of organizations but specific enough that they retain meaning when evaluating a specific organization.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is the first in a series of moves for the entire sector away from using Administrative cost ratios as a major factor in evaluating nonprofit effectiveness and towards using outcomes / results measurement to evaluate effectiveness instead.</p>
